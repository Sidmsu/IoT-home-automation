The provided code is a simple Python script that retrieves and displays weather information for a city via the OpenWeatherMap API. It performs the following functions:

Imports the requests library to make HTTP requests.

Defines an API key for using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Defines two functions:

fetch_weather(api_key, city): This function creates an API request URL with the specified city and the provided API key, sends an HTTP GET request to OpenWeatherMap, and returns the weather data in JSON format.
convert_kelvin_to_celsius(temp): This function converts a Kelvin temperature to a Celsius temperature by subtracting 273.15.
Enters a while loop that gives the user two options:

Option 1: Enter a city name.
Option 2: Exit the weather app.
The user's choice is obtained through user input.

If the user selects option 1, they are prompted to enter a city name.

If the user selects option 2, the application exits.

If the user enters an invalid option, an error message is displayed and the loop continues.

When a valid city name is entered, the script invokes the fetch_weather function to retrieve weather data for the specified city.

If weather data is available, it then extracts and displays the weather condition and temperature (in Celsius).

If the weather data for the specified city is not found, a message is displayed.

The script essentially functions as a basic weather application, allowing the user to look up weather information for a city by entering its name and displaying the current weather condition and temperature in Celsius.
